# Welcome to my Snake PyGame Project
# Project Overview and Explanation
# This project is a python-programmed recreation of the famed google snake game, in which a snake has to use the four directional arrow keys in order to capture the apple. The point of the game is to be able to capture apples for as long as possible; the two methods of elimination include the snake touching the barrier of the map or (assuming in the latter stages of the game that the snake is long), it curls around and makes contact with itself. Listed below are the copyright details and general explanation of the programming aspect of the game. 

# Installation, Usage and Requirements
# Copy the code into the vs code and intall the pygame extension to be compatible (publisher: Taiwo Kareem). Ensure you import the pygame extension in the first line before any code otherwise it won't function. I simply created this for recreational purposes, and the only requirements to run is the Python 3.x programming language and PyGame extension installed
