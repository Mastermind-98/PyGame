# Project Name: Snake PyGame
# Project Overview: This project is a python-programmed recreation of the famed google snake game, in which a snake has to use the four directional arrow keys in order to capture the apple. After the initial capture, the apple is repositioned in a completely randomised area on the map and the snake grows ever so slightly longer after every consumption. The point of the game is to be able to capture apples for as long as possible; the two methods of elimination include the snake touching the barrier of the map or (assuming in the latter stages of the game that the snake is long), it curls around and makes contact with itself. Listed below are the copyright details and general explanation of the programming aspect of the game.
